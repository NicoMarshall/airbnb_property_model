# airbnb_property_model
Data science project to create and evauluate different machine learning models that predict nightly prices of airbnb property listings.

# Milestone 1:
The first stage was cleaning and pre-processing the raw data to get it into the right format for ML. Methods created inside tabular_data.py to remove rows where ratings were missing, format description strings, set default values and split data into features, values tuples. Image data resized inside prepare_image_data.py, so that all images have the same height.
